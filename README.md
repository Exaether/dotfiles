# Installation

## Install script
TODO

## Manual
Install dependencies, and then just `ln -s` everything at the right place.

Intall tpm fot tmux:
`git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`
and then reload (`leader + r`) and install plugins (`leader + I`)
Also check zsh plugins for anything to install/setup (like for thefuck and zsh-completions)

Almost everything goes to `~/.config/`.
### exeptions
- tmux: link only the config file, not the entire folder
- zsh folder
	- .zshrc goes in `~/` (am i really writhing this?)
- local folder
	- `scripts/` goes directly in `~/.local/`
	- things in `share/` goes in `~/.local/share` (do not link the entire `share` folder, only what's inside)
- `wallpapers` folder goes in home
- that's about it.
